### A GLSL to ASM.js compiler

**This is a work in progress, and a lot of things don't work yet, so don't use it.**

Built using [jison](http://zaach.github.io/jison/) and [escodegen](https://github.com/Constellation/escodegen) with
a custom AST based on the Mozilla parser API spec with added type checking.
